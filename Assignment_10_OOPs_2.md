### 1. What is Inheritance in Java?
      -Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class can access the properties (methods and fields) of another class. 
      -It is one of the pillar of Object Orientation.
      -It always speaks about reusability.
      -In java inheritance is achieved through "extends" keyword.
### 2. What is superclass and subclass ?
      -The class that inherits the properties is known as the subclass, and the class whose properties are inherited is known as the superclass 
### 3. How is Inheritance implemented/achieved in Java?
      -In java inheritance is achieved through "extends" keyword.
### 4. What is polymorphism ?
      -If one thing exists in more than one form then it is known as polymorphism.
      -It is two types. 
      1. CompileTime Polymorphism
      2. RunTime Polymorphism
### 5. Differentiate between method overloading and overriding.
       -Two or more methods is said to be Overloaded if both methods have same name but change in the argument type.
      -It is known as compile time polymorphism.

      -If SuperClass method implementation then SubClass is allow to redefine that SuperClass method in SubClass in its own way this process is called as method Overriding.
      -It is known as run time polymorphism.
      
### 6. What is an abstraction explained with an Example ?
      

### 7. What is the difference between an abstract method and final method in Java? Explain with an example.

### 8. What is the final class in Java?
      -If a class is marked as final, then it can not be participate in inheritance.
      -examples : String ,Integer , Short ,Float.......etc.

### 9. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation .


### 10. Difference between Runtime and compile time polymorphism explain with an example.
      -Two or more methods is said to be Overloaded if both methods have same name but change in the argument type.
      -It is known as compile time polymorphism.

      -If SuperClass method implementation then SubClass is allow to redefine that SuperClass method in SubClass in its own way this process is called as method Overriding.
      -It is known as run time polymorphism.
