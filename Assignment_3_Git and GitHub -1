1. What is Git ?
    Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
    It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, manage different versions, and merge changes seamlessly.
2. What do you understand by the term ‘Version Control System’ ?
    A version control system is a software tool that helps track and manage changes to files over time. It allows multiple users to collaborate on a 
    project by keeping track of different versions of files, facilitating easy rollback to previous versions, and merging changes made by different 
    contributors.
    Eg: Git
3. What is GitHub ?
    GitHub is a website and hosting service that assists developers in storing and managing code, as well as tracking and controlling changes to the 
    project.
    It provide features such as code repositories, issue tracking, continuous integration, and collaboration tools merging changes made by different contributors.
4. Mention some popular Git hosting services .
    GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
5. Different types of version control system ?
    There are 3 main types of version control systems:
    a. Centralized version control system
    b. Distributed version control system
    c. Hybrid version control system
 6. What is the benefit of using GIT ?
    Git simplifies collaboration by allowing multiple people to work on a project simultaneously while keeping track of changes.
    It provides a version history that helps return to previous versions,ensuring code safety.
    With branching and merging, developers can experiment with new features without disrupting the main codebase.
7. What is Git repository ?
    A Git repository is a storage location that holds the entire history of a project, including all files, directories, and their respective versions. It 
    serves as a centralized hub where developers can collaborate, track changes, and manage the codebase. The repository contains branches, 
    commits, and other data that facilitate version control and team coordination.
 8. How can you initialize a repository in Git ?
    We can initialize a repository in Git using the command `git init` to  initialize a new Git repository in that directory .
