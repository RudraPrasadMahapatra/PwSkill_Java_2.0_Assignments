1. **What are Generics in Java?**
   **Ans:** Generics in Java are utilized to ensure type safety and minimize code duplication by enabling the use of generic types. They allow classes, methods, and interfaces to be written in a general form, without specifying the specific type of data being used.

2. **What are the benefits of using Generics in Java?**
   **Ans:** The advantages of using Generics in Java include:
   - Enhanced type safety
   - Reusability of code
   - Better readability
   - Less repetitive code
   - Increased performance

3. **What is a Generic Class in Java?**
   **Ans:** A Generic Class in Java is a class capable of handling various types of data. It is defined using a type parameter inside angle brackets, which symbolizes the type of data being utilized.

4. **What is a Type Parameter in Java Generics?**
   **Ans:** A Type Parameter in Java Generics is a placeholder for the type of data used by a generic class or method. It is denoted using a single uppercase letter enclosed in angle brackets, like `<T>` or `<E>`.

5. **What is a Generic Method in Java?**
   **Ans:** A Generic Method in Java is a method that can operate with different types of data. It is defined using a type parameter inside angle brackets, which represents the type of data being handled.

6. **What is the difference between ArrayList and ArrayList<T>?**
   **Ans:** ArrayList is a non-generic class, while `ArrayList<T>` is a generic class. `ArrayList<T>` ensures type safety, as it can only store elements of a specified type, whereas `ArrayList` can store any type of element.
