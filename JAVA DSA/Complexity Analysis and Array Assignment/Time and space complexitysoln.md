### Question 1: Analyze the time complexity of the following Java code and suggest a way to improve it:
```java
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i < n; i *= 4) {
    for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
        sum++;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- The outer loop runs with `i` starting from 1 and multiplying by 4 each time until it is less than `n`. This loop runs `O(log4(n))` times, which simplifies to `O(log(n))` since the logarithm base change is a constant factor.
- The inner loop runs `i` times for each value of `i`. Hence, it will run `1 + 4 + 16 + ...` up to `O(n)`.
- The total time complexity is `O(n)`.

**Improvement Suggestion:**
Since the inner loop iterates `i` times, we can optimize the code depending on the specific use case. Here, assuming there are no specific improvements to be made without context, maintaining this `O(n)` time complexity is reasonable for linear iterations.

### Question 2: Find the value of T(2) for the recurrence relation \( T(n) = 3T(n-1) + 12n \), given that \( T(0) = 5 \).
**Solution:**
To find \( T(2) \):
- \( T(0) = 5 \)
- \( T(1) = 3T(0) + 12(1) = 3(5) + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27 \)
- \( T(2) = 3T(1) + 12(2) = 3(27) + 12(2) = 81 + 24 = 105 \)

Therefore, \( T(2) = 105 \).

### Question 3: Given a recurrence relation, solve it using a substitution method.
**Relation: \( T(n) = T(n - 1) + c \)**
**Solution:**
Using substitution:
- \( T(n) = T(n-1) + c \)
- \( T(n-1) = T(n-2) + c \)
- \( T(n-2) = T(n-3) + c \)
Continuing this process:
- \( T(n) = T(n-1) + c \)
- \( T(n) = T(n-2) + 2c \)
- \( T(n) = T(n-3) + 3c \)
...
- \( T(n) = T(0) + nc \)

Given \( T(0) \):
- \( T(n) = T(0) + nc \)

### Question 4: Given a recurrence relation:
**\( T(n) = 16T(n/4) + n^2 \log n \)**
**Find the time complexity using the master theorem.**

**Solution:**
For \( T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n) \):
- \( a = 16 \)
- \( b = 4 \)
- \( f(n) = n^2 \log n \)

Using the Master Theorem:
- \( f(n) = O(n^c \log^k n) \), here \( c = 2 \) and \( k = 1 \).
- Compare \( f(n) \) with \( n^{\log_b a} \):
  - \( \log_b a = \log_4 16 = 2 \).

Since \( f(n) = n^2 \log n \) is polynomially larger than \( n^2 \) by a \( \log n \) factor,
- The dominant term is \( f(n) \).

Thus, the time complexity is \( T(n) = \Theta(n^2 \log n) \).

### Question 5: Solve the following recurrence relation using the recursion tree method.
**Relation: \( T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n \)**

**Solution:**
- Each level of the tree halves the input size: \( T(n/2), T(n/4), \ldots \).
- The height of the tree is \( \log n \).
- Each level's cost is \( n \).

Summing the costs at all levels:
- \( n + n + \ldots + n \) (for \( \log n \) levels),
- Total cost: \( n \log n \).

Therefore, the time complexity is \( T(n) = O(n \log n) \).

### Question 6: Solve \( T(n) = 2T(n/2) + K \) using the Recurrence tree method.
**Solution:**
- Each level of the tree halves the input size: \( T(n/2), T(n/4), \ldots \).
- The height of the tree is \( \log n \).
- Each level's cost is a constant \( K \).

Summing the costs at all levels:
- \( K + K + \ldots + K \) (for \( \log n \) levels),
- Total cost: \( K \log n \).

Therefore, the time complexity is \( T(n) = O(\log n) \).
